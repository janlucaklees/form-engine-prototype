# Form Engine Prototype

In this repo I am prototyping a form library that can handle the most complex forms out there.

## Quickstart
1. Change into the library dir with `cd form-engine`.
2. Run `bun install` to install packages.
3. Run `bun link` to make the library part available locally for development.
4. Change into the frontend part `cd ../frontend`.
5. Run `bun install` to install packages there as well.
6. Run `bun link form-engine` to "install" the library part as if it were a normal npm package.
7. Run `bun dev` to start things up.
